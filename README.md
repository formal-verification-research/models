# models
Models for Zhen Zhang's research group. This is a collection of ALL of our models, including (but not limited to) CRNs, Dafny models, Neural Nets, etc.

## Structure

Let's use a simple file structure to collect all the files and model types we can for each system. For example:
- CRN
   - ModifiedYeastPolarization
       - ModifiedYeastPolarization.crn
       - ModifiedYeastPolarization.prop
       - ModifiedYeastPolarization.sm
   - ...
- Dafny
  - ...
- NeuralNet
  - ...
